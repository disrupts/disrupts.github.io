    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend was the 4º <em><a href="http://www.smalicante.com/">Salón del Manga de Alicante</a></em>, an manga/anime/games-centric <em>con</em> at my hometown.
I missed the first three editions, living abroad, and therefore was impatient to go. As you may have guessed from the title, it was incredibly fun.</p>

<p>The day was great, a real catharsis. More so than any film, tv-show or maybe even book I&rsquo;ve enjoyed recently.
I&rsquo;ve got my good-old smile back, and it&rsquo;ll be there for long! &ndash; could be my inner-child taking the wheel this month.</p>

<p>Ok, but what was so enjoyable of it?</p>

<p>Are nice people all over the place to meet, many great costumes and weirder fandoms than yours not enough?
Cause, you know:
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s always a bigger fish</p><footer><strong>Qui-Gon Jinn</strong> <cite>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what happened there (at least what I saw of it, saturday afternoon).</p>

<p>Here are some picks from the cosplay contest!</p>

<p>Competition was harsh, and costumes very elaborate. But please, give me a hand spotting the fandoms!</p>

<p>What if your thing is more video-games? There was also a contest for you.
And even old-school titles that resonate deep in the memories of my generation.</p>

<p>There was even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_64"><em>Mario Kart 64</em></a> contest going on! Arcade racing for everyone.</p>

<p>Many people my age and many more younger teens enjoyed the show, but also entire families sharing their cosplay theme!</p>

<p>I even <em>caught</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mew_%28Pok%C3%A9mon%29">Pokemon</a>! No glitch required &ndash; I hope the younger ones will get that reference, if you don&rsquo;t please ask around, it&rsquo;ll be fun!</p>

<p>There even was a concert within the con.</p>

<p>And a small but fully-packed console expo! From a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey">Magnavox Odyssey</a> a limited edition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSX_%28video_game_console%29">PSX</a> directly from japan!</p>

<p>Before talking about cosplays, let&rsquo;s talk about tea!</p>

<p>I had my first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea">bubble tea</a>. Mango! Loved the taste, although bubbles were a little to strong for me. It deffinitly won&rsquo;t the last! Sorry there is no picture, I was too concentrated, enjoying the drink while listening WhiteNoise play.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already said costumes were great, but I can&rsquo;t say it loud enough! and of every style you can think of.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saving the best for the end!</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/2014-04-08-4o-salon-del-manga-de-alicante-a-blast/manga_alicante_2014_12.jpg" width="650" title="A real-life Satsuki Kiryuin" ></p>

<p>That cosplayer nailed it, the costume is incredible and the pose was so faithful I was shocked.
I hopped to find a Satsuki cosplay, but I had to wait nearly to the end of the day to come across her! &ndash; ok, I might be a little biased towards that character, I won&rsquo;t admit it though.</p>

<p>I even found a few <em>ToG</em> fans! (yes, SIU has me addicted).</p>

<p>To be fair, the conference was dominated by <em>Attack on Titan</em>. It was by far the biggest fan-group.</p>

<p>There were a few martial arts demo too, too bad I had no time for it (As traditional Jiu Jitsu fan, I would have loved the Japanese archery demo).</p>

<p>Wrapping up, don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your fandoms' there&rsquo;s a reason you like them! (and you&rsquo;re not the only one).</p>
