*UPDATE 2014: I've just migrated from Wordpress and decided not to add an external comment system to avoid trackers! I'm still deciding if the site should run open source anonymous analytics. I also want to thank [Heinrich Faust](http://hfaust.me/) and [Ruben Schade](http://rubenerd.com/) for their blogs that give me the extra motivation I need to keep writing.*

I’m not expecting any one to read all of this <del>(or should I say, this crap)</del> but I can but be thankful if anyone does.

**Thank you**

I somehow owe you for reading the deep thoughts of my mind I ended up publishing without thinking about it; thoughts which I don’t expect to be very helpful to humanity but which are, if anything else, at least truly **sincere**.

My [email](mailto:disrupts@outlook.com) is **disrupts at outlook dot com**.
I'll be glad to receive comments there and add the conversations to the blog posts!
