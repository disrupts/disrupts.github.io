*UPDATE 2014: I've just migrated from Wordpress and decided not to add an external comment system to avoid trackers! I'm still deciding if the site should open source anonymitysing analytics. I also want to thank [Heinrich Faust](http://hfaust.me/) and [Ruben Schade](http://rubenerd.com/) for their blogs that give me the extra motivation I needed to keep writing regularly.*

I’m not expecting any one to read all of this <del>(or should i say, this crap)</del> but i can but be thankful if anyone does.

**Thank you**

I somehow owe you for reading the deep thoughts of my mind i ended up publishing without thinking about it; thoughts which i don’t expect to be very helpful to humanity but which are, if anything else, at least truly **sincere**.

Contact me at (it'll be up soon).
