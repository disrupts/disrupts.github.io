I never thought I would end up posting wallpapers from someone else when I started the blog. I follow some writers who used to do that and even posted them once a week (such as [Heinrich Faust](http://hfaust.me/)).

There will be a difference, I will only post wallpapers I have actually used and keep for a reasonably long period of time! Let's say at least a month (an etternety for wallpapers, once you get into the habit of changing them they tend to last less and less).

This time I'll start with a [*Kill la Kill*](http:www.wikipedia.org/kill_la_kill), as a follow up from the [*con*](/4o-salon-del-manga-de-alicante)

You can find the original in a higher resolution at [pixiv.net](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=42044254), and thanks to [しょういん](http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=2148690) who's the original artist!

What do you think? worth of your background? *(it is still occupying mine)*

See you soon

*I'm still figuring out how to include a link in an image to let you click strait to the original.*
