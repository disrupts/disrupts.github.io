<time datetime="2015-02-14T12:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 14<span>th</span>, 2015</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little background story: I wanted to play some music with my MIDI keyboard
and had a Pentium 4 desktop laying around with no display.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/assets/images/2015-02-14-openbsd-great-base-system-to-test-and-play-midi/Rock.jpg" width="200"></p>

<p>I had already installed OpenBSD on it to give it a try (and update the Ubuntu
10.10 install I hadn’t touched in years). During the install I decided to keep
the default OpenSSH running and configure the WiFi network. That&rsquo;s it, I had a
server to connect to! And I found out there was a console-based MIDI sequencer
for OpenBSD: <a href="http://www.midish.org">midish</a>!</p>

<p>The end result is simple, everything works!</p>

<p>Now I’ll give you the details of this fast setup.</p>

<p>The first thing is to check if the OS is registering the MIDI input properly.
The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq13.html#midi">OpenBSD FAQ</a> has good info about it. Just connect it, check
<code>dmesg</code> for a new midi interface and cat the input to the screen!
Here’s the one liner from the FAQ:</p>

<pre><code>aucat -Mq rmidi/1 -o - | hexdump -e '1/1 "%02x\n"'
</code></pre>

<p>I kind of messed up everything from here because my USB keyboard (Roland)
wasn’t outputting <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man4/umidi.4">standard MIDI</a>. Just have a look at the user manual
of your instruments and check if they do, or if there is a way to fallback to
standard (as I found out later).</p>

<p>Now it’s time to start the sequencer and choose a sound module! If you have a
hardware one, good for you. I picked the first I found on the ports tree:
<a href="http://openports.se/audio/fluidsynth">fluidsynth</a>. Pick your install method, I chose the package.</p>

<p>Ok, now all pieces are there, the last step is to set them up.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/sndiod.1">sndiod man-page</a> has some good info but the midish one is pretty
sparce for what we are trying to accomplish. Go to the <a href="http://www.midish.org/manual.html">official manual</a>,
there the docs are a lot better.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/disrupts/dotfiles/blob/master/.midishrc">my midishrc</a> in case you want some inspiration:</p>

<pre><code># Device 0: Roland      # keys: 0, drumpad: 9
dnew 0 "rmidi/1"    ro
inew roland_keys    {0 0}
inew roland_drumpad {0 9}

# Device 1: fluidsynth  # drums: 9, piano: others
dnew 1 "midithru/0" wo
onew fluid_piano    {1 0}
onew fluid_drums    {1 9}

# Connect Roland to fluidsynth
fnew fluidsynth
fmap {any roland_keys}    {any fluid_piano}
fmap {any roland_drumpad} {any fluid_drums}
</code></pre>

<p>It should be pretty much self explanatory. I use midish to send the midi input
from the keyboard to the synth. You could do that by piping the output of the
interface straight to fluidsynth (with <code>aucat</code> just like the earlier
test) but you lose lots of control and the ability to record what you’re
playing.</p>

<p>Everything is ready, start the soft-synth if you use one, start midish and
enter an interactive mode (<code>i</code> for example). You should be able to
play and hear some sounds!</p>

<p>However I still had a big problem: lag. There was half a second between a key
press and the audio. Not great.</p>

<p>So I went back to the mailing lists (I checked some to setup midish properly).
And there I found the <a href="http://ports.openbsd.narkive.com/IRU25u0b/midi-softsynth">missing answer</a>. Alexandre Ratchov, author of
both <code>sndiod</code> and <code>midish</code> had already posted an answer
with the config values he uses to play!</p>

<p>And it worked. Here they are, all together:</p>

<pre><code>sndiod -r48000 -b240 -z120
rmidish # (then start with i, or p or other to save, with a midishrc)
fluidsynth -c 2 -z 128 -g 0.5 /usr/local/share/generaluser-gs/GeneralUser_GS.sf2
</code></pre>

<p>A few more comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may configure <code>rmidish</code> on the fly instead of writting a
midishrc file, the interpreter works nicely!</p></li>
<li><p><code>sndiod</code> daemon should already be runnning but with the default
flags from <code>rc.conf</code>; restarting it without a reboot works without
issues and if you have a dedicated machine you might want to edit
<code>rc.conf.local</code></p></li>
<li><p>Fluidsynth needs an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont">soundfont</a>. Luckily there’s one in the ports
tree to: <a href="http://openports.se/audio/generaluser-gs-soundfont">generaluser-gs-soundfont</a>. It is the one used in the
previous example.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll also need to keep fluidsynth in the foreground otherwise it won’t play
back sound. <code>tmux</code>, <code>dtach</code> or <code>abduco</code>
should do the trick if you want to stop the connection.</p></li>
<li><p>Ah and the <code>-g 0.5</code> flag to fluidsynth is just to increase the
gain, it has nothing to do with MIDI.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Just one more thing, there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.midish.org/mail.html">midish mailing list</a>. You might want
to check out the <a href="http://www.midish.org/arch/">archive</a>.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE 16/02</em></p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t played piano in 4 years, but it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I expected. My
fingers felt numb and unresponsive yet my muscle memory was surprisingly good.
After a few minutes practising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIbmfDvQA5U"><em>Across the Stars</em></a> the cords were
coming back!</p>

<p>I also managed to bring back from the dead my old (over 12 years old) Yamaha
keyboard. Nothing was wrong with it but around 6 years ago I bought a MIDI/USB
interface to use it as a controller but never managed to get it working (it was
on Windows XP back in the day). Yesterday I remembered the interface was laying
around and after a few minutes, it was connected and <code>dmesg</code> showed
OpenBSD had found it! After a little more <a href="https://github.com/disrupts/dotfiles/blob/master/.midishrc">tweaking</a>, I playing with
both keyboards!</p>

<p>The only thing left I have to say is:   <em>Merci Alexandre</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted something.
Exams are here and until next moth I won&rsquo;t be writing much, but hey, I have a few blog-posts waiting to be posted, so be patient!</p>

<p>If you want to read something else, I&rsquo;ll give you a link or two for those of you who can read Spanish.</p>

<p>Un buen blog sobre <em>anime</em> ha abierto sus puertas: <a href="http://tsunderetheories.wordpress.com/"><em>FUWA-FUWA TSUNDERE THEORIES</em></a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/2014-06-17-i-ll-be-back-soon/moe.jpg" width="700" title="Arquetipos del anime" ></p>

<p>Es el regreso del autor de <a href="http://seriousmoe.wordpress.com/"><em>Serious Moe Business</em></a>, regreso esperado (por mi parte).</p>

<p>No he encontrado el articulo original en portugués pero os dejo un resumen en castellano del <a href="http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2014/06/20/portada/1403273969_693687.html">artículo</a> de Tostao para la Folha de Sao Paulo sobre el fútbol del mundial. Es un pequeño homenaje al fútbol español.</p>

<p>Espero que os guste la lectura!</p>

<p>Just one more thing, I just received my <a href="http://nfcring.com">NFC Ring</a> and it&rsquo;s awesome. I&rsquo;ll write more about it very soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>UPDATE June 2014: The easter egg is from CyanogenMod! Thanks guys, you&rsquo;re doing a great job, and with humour!</em></p>

<p>Your read right, there is an Easter egg in Android!
And about (old-school) <em>Pokemon</em>!, straight from the nineties.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/2014-05-05-a-pokemon-easter-egg-in-android-4-dot-4/android_easter-egg.jpg" width="800"></p>

<p>The screen-shot is from a Galaxy Nexus running a nightly build of CM-11. I don&rsquo;t know if the Easter-egg comes from Google or the CyanogenMod team.
Now that you know, why not twisting the subject a bit!</p>

<p>You might have recognised the <em>Privacy Guard</em> icon! Yes, the one from <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod</a>.
I&rsquo;ve been running the nightly builds on my phone for a year and a half and it really works for me.</p>

<p>This ROM suits my way of <a href="/go-modal">understanding technology</a>. It is a stripped down version of android (stock android) with granular control and many extra configurations, neat and clean!</p>

<p>Aside from a few <em>hiccups</em> (such as the proximity sensor turning off the screen but not disabling the touch-screen in 4.2 (CM-10.1) for some weeks) it is a great experience and always gratifying when after an update you see the new features pop out!</p>

<p>It is always nice to find an Easter egg in software, reminds me of the time when every single video-game add some hidden (or not so hidden) cheats and we used to get them in magazines! Back in the PlayStation (yes, I&rsquo;m talking about the first one that some will remember as PSX) and early PS2 days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Art is about telling a story</em></p>

<p>Any form of art I can thing of right now somehow wishes to tell a story, let it be music, paintings or even photography (this one deserves a whole post).
Even Richard Serra sculptures (I love them by the way) tell stories, and deep ones with yourself as the protagonist.</p>

<p>Why this intro? because video-games are also storytelling devices.
They can also be Art.</p>

<p>I recently played through <a href="http://www.gonehomegame.com/"><em>Gone Home</em></a> and loved it, I enjoyed every part of it.
From the heartwarming love story, the storm sounds, the music to the horror-game-like environment.
It was so good I was almost in tears by the end of it (especially during the-last-gig journal entry).</p>

<p>Yet this is not what I want to talk about today.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/images/2014-04-22-gone-home/gone_home_kiss.jpg" width="700" title="A lovely fan art by fortheloveofpizza" ></p>

<p>The best part of it is that story can&rsquo;t be told effectively in any other form of media.
It could be a lovely short story or novel, or even a film but it would lose most of it&rsquo;s strength.</p>

<p>The real magic of the game is just that. Being a game, letting you be the protagonist. You have the last word about what you should see, read, learn and experience during the game. It doesn&rsquo;t force you through a linear path feeding you the plot &ndash; nor the background information about the characters.</p>

<p>It is your decision if you want to go through the house and dig up the secondary stories.
No one forces you to learn how the relationship between Janice and Terrance is, or Terrance current job issues (and alcohol ones), not even Oscar&rsquo;s deep dark storyline.</p>

<p><a href="http://clockworkworlds.com/post/58411117679/the-transgression-you-can-do-better">Oscar&rsquo;s past</a> (beware of the <strong>spoiler</strong> if you follow this link) is the one that really shines. It is the easiest to miss.
It makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Sam&rsquo;s last year is the main plot and thus the only one &ldquo;forced&rdquo; on you (this is not what I meant, you&rsquo;re playing it for that story, I hope you get my point).
Your parents story is more difficult to grasp, yet easy to find. Both live in that house. We can clearly see who fills each room or space of the house and Sam gets the most of it.
Oscar is no longer living but he still is the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the basement and the secret passages. His story is also the further away in time.
This concept shines with him: his darker secrets are implicit within the little evidence that remains&hellip;</p>

<p>What do you think about it? Have you played it?</p>

<p>Do you share this point of view about video games? Do you think they can offer alternative ways of communication and storytelling?</p>

<p>By the way, did you also fall for Sam? She is just so cute, and with a very deep voice acting!</p>

<p>There is little more I have to say about it (and so much has already been said), so I’ll give you a few links as a follow up:</p>
